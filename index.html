          Thorfinn (トルフィン Torufin?) Thorsson, also nicknamed Karlsefni, is
          a former warrior of Askeladd's band as well as a former slave on
          Ketil’s farm, who is currently a trader and adventurer attempting to
          settle in Vinland. He is the main protagonist of Vinland Saga. He was
          born in Iceland as the son of Helga and Thors, the most famous
          Jomsviking warrior until his defection. He is also the brother to
          Ylva, and is related to the leadership of the Jomsvikings through his
          mother, who is daughter of the third Cheif, Sigvaldi. He spent an
          entire decade attempting to take revenge on Askeladd, the man who
          killed his father, even following him into battle to stay close to
          him, and grew cold and merciless, killing countless people. After he
          attacked Canute in a moment of shock and rage for killing Askeladd,
          the death of whom was Thorfinn's goal for most of his life, Thorfinn
          was enslaved as a punishment. Four years later he gained his freedom
          and changed his life. He vowed to make good of his life and create
          peace and a land free of slavery in Vinland, which he heard from Leif
          Ericson’s tales as a child. After leaving Ketil’s farm with a new
          friend, Einar, he then journeyed to Greece in order to get money to be
          able to make the trip to Vinland, and after three years he had enough
          money and people to finally make his journey to Vinland. He created
          Arnheid Village on Vinland.
