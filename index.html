              Thorfinn (トルフィン Torufin?) Thorsson, also nicknamed Karlsefni,
              is a former warrior of Askeladd's band as well as a former slave
              on Ketil’s farm, who is currently a trader and adventurer
              attempting to settle in Vinland. He is the main protagonist of
              Vinland Saga. He was born in Iceland as the son of Helga and
              Thors, the most famous Jomsviking warrior until his defection. He
              is also the brother to Ylva, and is related to the leadership of
              the Jomsvikings through his mother, who is daughter of the third
              Cheif, Sigvaldi. He spent an entire decade attempting to take
              revenge on Askeladd, the man who killed his father, even following
              him into battle to stay close to him, and grew cold and merciless,
              killing countless people. After he attacked Canute in a moment of
              shock and rage for killing Askeladd, the death of whom was
              Thorfinn's goal for most of his life, Thorfinn was enslaved as a
              punishment. Four years later he gained his freedom and changed his
              life. He vowed to make good of his life and create peace and a
              land free of slavery in Vinland, which he heard from Leif
              Ericson’s tales as a child. After leaving Ketil’s farm with a new
              friend, Einar, he then journeyed to Greece in order to get money
              to be able to make the trip to Vinland, and after three years he
              had enough money and people to finally make his journey to
              Vinland. He created Arnheid Village on Vinland.
